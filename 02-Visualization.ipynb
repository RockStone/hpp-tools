    "Visualizing large amounts of data presents challenges for both speed and fidelity. Several of the [PyViz](https://pyviz.org/index.html) libraries are specifically design for high perf and high volume, and have additional plugins to support interactivity via Bokeh.\n",

    "### Datashader\n",
    "\n",
    "__Datashader__ is an open-source library for analyzing and visualizing large datasets. \n",
    "* designed to \"rasterize\" or \"aggregate\" datasets into regular grids that can be viewed as images\n",
    "* can plot a billion points in a second or so on a 16GB laptop\n",
    "* scales up easily to out-of-core, distributed, or GPU processing for even larger datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in Python but transparently compiled to machine code using Numba and flexibly distributed across CPU cores and processors using Dask or GPUs using CUDA, providing a highly optimized rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware while exploiting distributed and GPU systems when available."
